# Backend server requirements for Flask email API
flask
# Email support is built-in (smtplib), no external needed

# EXE client (tkinter) - no pip install needed, always in stdlib
# If you use requests (for HTTP POST in client):
requests

# If running on PythonAnywhere/Heroku/production, pin versions for safety:
# flask==3.0.3
# requests==2.31.0
